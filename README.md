# Target Case Study: API Consumption

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

For this program you'll need to install Requests for Python.

Make sure Python is added to your Path and pip is working, then type the following:
	
	pip install requests

This should allow you to properly run the script

## Running

Open a Command Prompt window and navigate to the directory where nextbus.py is contained.

Running the script is as simple as running the script like the following:
	
	nextbus.py "{BUS ROUTE}" "{BUS STOP NAME}" "{DIRECTION}"

An example would be something like this:
	
	nextbus.py "Brklyn Center - Fremont - 26th Av - Chicago - MOA" "7th St  and Olson Memorial Hwy" "north"

## Built with:

- Requests: HTTP for Humans - http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/
